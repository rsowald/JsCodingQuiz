## High Scores Dilemma
The high scores link in the header was a real hurdle in this project. The mock-up included the link in the header, but I wanted a polished UI that didn't load an otherwise empty HTML page to show the high scores list. So, I opted for a modal. If the quiz portion of the page would still be visible when the high scores modal was shown, I had to decide whether to pause the timer. However, if the modal paused the timer, then it would be possible for the user to essentially pause on a question and have all the time in the world to look up an answer. So, I thought I could pause the timer and change the modal background color so the question wouldn't be visible, but that still allowed the user to read the question, pause the timer to look up answers, and then come back to it. So, the most logical solution seemed to be to remove the question altogether. When the quiz div is visible, the high scores button is hidden. While it is a departure from the mock-up, it seems far more logical to me than being able to navigate away from the quiz in progress.
